					<u>Why does your website look like it was made in the 90s?</u> <br>
					Becuase it makes use of a bright, clashing color scheme, an IBM computer inspired font, and an excessive number of gifs.

					<u>Why does your website make use of a bright, clashing color scheme, an IBM computer inspired font, and an excessive number of gifs?</u> <br>
					To make it look like it was made in the 90s.

					<u>Seriously, this place looks like Linus Torvalds' bad trip. Whyyyy?</u> <br>
					To be honest, there are two reasons. First and foremost, I just like the aesthetic. It makes me nostalgic for a time I didn't really get to
					experience firsthand. I mean, I technically did, but I was so young it feels like more like a dream than something I actually lived through. 
					The other is a bit more practical. I have to come clean: modern websites drive me <i>crazy</i>. It's something about the futuristic, 
					rounded corners with excessive parallax and millions of animations; ughhh. Not that there's anything wrong with them. It's a me problem.
					Unfornatetly, it's a me problem I have a hard time getting past. I mean, they can work, but more often then not they don't, in my opinion.

				</p></li>

					<u>How did you get into programming?</u> <br>
					Depends on how you define programming. My first "real" language was C++, which I tried to learn from YouTube videos and Stack Overflow 
					back in middle school. Not that I was any good (I refused to even touch pointers for years), but I fell in love almost instantly and 
					had a blast making silly little programs! I was also a big TI-BASIC fan since I could mess around in class when the teacher wasn't looking, haha. I think I've 
					always been fascinated by computers though. Before this I was obsessed with modding,
					especially in Minecraft and Skyrim. It brought me immense joy to be able to mess around with the game files and then to see the consequences of those changes
					in game. I felt like anything was possible! Oh and speaking of Minecraft, I'm 99% sure that my interest in redstone as a kid is why I'm studying
					computer science now.

					<u>What kind of music do you like?</u> <br>
					Starting with rchestral/classical. I love Rachmoninoff, especially his second piano concerto and his preludes. Chopin is another one of my go-tos,
					notably his first ballade and mazurkas. Outside of the romantic era, I really like the Devil's Trill sonata, as well as Beethoven's symphonies 
					(especially the 9th). For something more modern, the Kid Icarus, Super Mario Galaxy and Octopath Traveler soundtracks will always have a special place in my heart. I can keep going 
					of course, but there are other genres to get to. I'm also super into electronic music, with emphasis on breakcore and chiptune. For the former,
					Venetian Snares (see Rossz Csillag Alatt Szuletett and Hospitality), Igorrr, and Ars Dada are classics. For the latter, I'd recommend FearOfDark, Goto80, and 
					Dominique Guiot (this last one is more synth than chiptune, but oh well),
					among others. Alrighty; lightning round! If you're into jazz, I can't recommend Casiopea enough. For Bossa Nova,
					you can't go wrong with Stan Getz and Astrud Gilberto.
					For city pop, Meiko Nakahara is probably my favorite, but Mariya Takeuchi takes a close second. More recently, I've been getting into metal, and for 
					that I can't recommend System of a Down, Tina S, or Master Boot Record enough. Also, not sure where they fit, but Koronba, Chicago, Is the Order a Rabbit?, and Tangerine Dream.

					<u>Do you have any video game recommendations?</u> <br>
					Similar to the music question, I like too many games to answer this completely. That said, I can certainly list a few of my favorites! Minecraft is probably my most played game of all
					time, and I don't think it'll ever be beat. It's just too good, to the point to where I'd call it an important part of my life. Along with that, there's Disco Elysium, Neon White, 
					Mario Galaxy 1 and 2, Half-Life 2, Portal, Bioshock, Plants vs. Zombies, The Elder Scrolls, Terraria, Doki Doki Literature Club, and a million other ones! 
				</p></li>

					<u>Where did you get the assets to make the site?</u> <br>
					Believe it or not, I made most of them myself. That said, I got the super cool font from http://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/, adapted the
					CV image from https://www.logolynx.com/topic/curriculum, and adapted the email image from https://www.cleanpng.com/png-envelope-computer-icons-mail-symbol-email-1250817/.

				<li><p>
					<u>Who's asking these questions frequently enough to warrant an FAQ?</u> <br>
					Oh man, you're on to me. I'm outta here :O!
